# Route Optimizer Software

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Project

This project was created by CC Ahrens, Cin Ahrens, and Nelson Athow, with contributions made in the early
development process by Lindsey Schneider and Aaron Lee. We received support and guidance from Dr. Sara
Billey, as well as Molly Deal, the Home Delivery Program Coordinator for the University District Food Bank
in Seattle.

### See the website

Open [https://ccahrens.github.io/rt-opt/](https://ccahrens.github.io/rt-opt/) to view our website in the
browser. Here, you will find more information about the team, the software, and how to use our product.
We hope to soon make our software easily usable by the public, but it is currently still under development.

### How our software works

Our software will allow food banks and other charity organizations that deliver to households to optimize
their delivery routes easily, quickly, and at no cost. Using a combination of Python, OR Tools, Docker,
Gurobipy, we've made route optimization for many deliveries and many drivers as simple as possible.
